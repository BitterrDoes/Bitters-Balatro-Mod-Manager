# BitterDoes' Balatro Mod Manager

Hi, im bitter and after a bit of annoyance from the most popular balatro mod manager I decided that I'm just gonna make my own.
Before this project I didnt know a lick of python, and thanks to this project I now do!

## Functions

- **a clean and hopefully slick ui made with the ctk library**
- **buttons to disable and enable any downloaded mods**
- **deleting mods**
- *a play button....*
- uuh....
- i mean the text for the window has some flavor text I guess
